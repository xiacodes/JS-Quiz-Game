## What is localStorage in JavaScript?
localStorage is a web storage API in JavaScript that allows you to store key-value pairs in a web browser, even after the browser is closed. Unlike cookies, localStorage has no expiration date and will persist until it is manually cleared by the user or programmatically cleared by your JavaScript code.

This project utilizes localStorage to store the user's score and progress in the quiz, allowing them to pick up where they left off the next time they visit the page.

## Features
- A multiple-choice quiz on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Stored user's progress and score using localStorage
